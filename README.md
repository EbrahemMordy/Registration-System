# Registration System Simulation in C++

## Overview

This repository contains a simple registration system simulation implemented in C++. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic concepts of data structures, file handling, and object-oriented programming in C++. The registration system is designed to manage user information, including registration, login, and data persistence.

## Features

1. **User Registration:** Users can create an account by providing necessary information such as username, password, and email.

2. **User Login:** Registered users can log in using their credentials.

3. **Data Persistence:** User data is stored in a file to ensure that it persists between program runs.

4. **Password Encryption:** Passwords are encrypted to enhance security.

5. **User Interface:** The program has a simple console-based user interface for ease of use.
